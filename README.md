##ProjectBasedLearning 

- A collection of small projects I’ve built while learning different concepts, tools, and technologies.
This repository serves as a personal archive of experiments, games, and mini-projects that showcase my progress over time.

📌 About

This repo is meant to document my learning journey through project-based learning.
Instead of just reading or watching tutorials, I focus on building small, hands-on projects to better understand new topics.

.

🎯 Goals

Reinforce concepts through practical coding.

Build a portfolio of mini-projects over time.

Make learning fun and engaging through games and interactive ideas.

📖 Future Plans

Add more documented learnings with each project.

Expand into different languages, frameworks, and domains.

Possibly refactor old projects as my skills improve.
