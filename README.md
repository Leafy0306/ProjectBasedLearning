# ProjectBasedLearning 

A collection of small projects I’ve built while learning different concepts, tools, and technologies.  
This repository serves as a personal archive of experiments, games, and mini-projects that showcase my progress over time.

## 📌 About  
This repo is meant to document my learning journey through **project-based learning**.  
Instead of just reading or watching tutorials, I focus on building **small, hands-on projects** to better understand new topics.  

Projects range from:  
- 🎮 **Small games** (logic-based, simple mechanics, console or graphical)  
- 🛠️ **Mini applications** (utilities, scripts, experiments)  
- 💡 **Concept demos** (to practice algorithms, frameworks, or APIs)
